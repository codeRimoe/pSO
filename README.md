## A  probabilistic  framework  based  on  the  gradient  descent algorithm for multi-objective land use optimization

This is an implementation of the probabilistic framework with the probabilistic multi-objective optimization of land use (pMOLU) model and gradient descent algorithm for land use optimization.

We provide the open-source code and data for the paper here.
